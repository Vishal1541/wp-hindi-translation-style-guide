## General Guidelines

> Note: A basic understanding of [types of translation](https://github.com/WPWale/wp-hindi-translation-style-guide/blob/draft/docs/types-translation.md) is needed to understand these.

Even before devising a full style guide, the author feels that if translators follow a few basic principles, they won't need to refer a formal guide. A guide would, in fact, become a barrier in productivity if you had to look it up again and again. Keeping this in mind, think of this as a TLDR; version of the whole guide.

### 1. Human, not Machine

Machine translations like that performed by Google translate are a great tool for translators to understand the original string and to find synonyms that can be used instead. Copy-pasting their output is lazy and such contribution is first of all, useless and then a waste of time for translators, editors and users alike. Why spend your time doing something that could have been done with an API?

### 2. Communicative, not Literal

Translating does not meaning taking a sentence and replacing it word by word with its Hindi equivalent. Instead, think of what meaning the sentence is trying to convey to a user, in the given context and what is the user expected to do as a result of reading the text. It doesn't matter if the sentence is completely different from the original as long as it conveys the context, meaning and intentions.

### 3. Functionality, not Linguistic Pride

Yes, Hindi is a great language with a great history and it is absolutely okay to be proud of your lingusitic heritage and tradition. 

However, a software is built for a purpose and anything that interferes with its functionality and usage is going to be counter-productive. Just because the translation of a word exists in Hindi doesn't mean we must use it. Translating `keyboard` to `कुंजि-पटल` is probably a greater disservice to Hindi because it'll confuse users and prevent them from using WordPress in Hindi. Think about what is more important – creating a version of WordPress that is un-understandable and useless for people looking to use it or creating a non-dogmatic version that's easier to use and adopt which will lead to the publishing and availability of tonnes of content in Hindi? What will help the cause of Hindi more?
