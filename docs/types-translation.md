# Types of Translations

Adapted from http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/84903/11/11_chapter-2.pdf

Technically, **eight** different types of translations are identified. I have divided them into three groups:

## For analysis & understanding of source language

### 1. Word-for-Word Translation

In this, the order of words of the source language is maintained and the words translated one by one by their most common meanings, out of context. Cultural words are translated literally. The main use of word-for-word translation is either to understand the mechanics of the source language or to break a difficult text down for understanding. 

### 2. Literal Translation

The source language grammatical constructions (made of structure words) are converted to their nearest target language equivalents but content words are again singly, out of context.
 
## For creative reproduction & detailed explanation

###  3. Faithful Translation

This translation attempts to be faithful to the precise contextual meaning of the original text within the constraints of the target language grammatical structures. It 'transfers' cultural words and preserves any degree of deviation in grammar and meaning from the source language norms. It attempts to be completely faithful to the intentions and the text realization of the source language writer.
 
### 4. Semantic Translation

Compared to 'faithful translation', semantic translation gives more importance to the beauty (aesthetic value) of the source language text. In doing so, it often compromises on the 'meaning' when needed so that the finished version retains its aesthetics. Less important cultural words are often replaced by culturally neutral third or functional terms but not by cultural equivalents. The distinction between 'faithful' and 'semantic' translation is that the first is uncompromising and dogmatic, while the second is more flexible. It prefers creativity over 100% fidelity and allows for the translator's intuitive empathy with the original. 
### 5. Adaptation

This is the 'freest' form of translation. It is used mainly for plays, poetry and creative works. The themes, characters and plots are usually preserved, the source language culture is converted to the target language culture and the text is rewritten.
 
### 6. Free Translation

Free translation is usually longer and lengthier than the original text and usually is more of a paraphrase and an explanation than a translation. It's more about conveying the matter (content) than the style.

## For better understanding of readers

### 7. Idiomatic Translation

Idiomatic translation reproduces the 'message' of the original but tends to change the finer  meaning by using phrases and idioms where these do not exist in the original.

### 8. Communicative Translation

Communicative translation tries to preserve the exact contextual meaning of the original in such a way that both content and language are readily acceptable and comprehensible to the reader.

## Summary

From the above, it is pretty obvious that the first category is what services like Google translate do. They are useful to understand the meaning of the text in source language but aren't useful as translations, at all.

The second category is more for creative and academic pursuits and not suitable for translating strings in a software.

The third category is more appropriate for translating a software so that it can be understood and used by the reader (user) comfortably. Of these, Idiomatic translation is more appropriate for marketing copies and lengthier texts usually pertaining to copywriting.

The most suitable & appropriate type of translation is communicative, where the focus is on conveying the exact meaning and context, rather than sticking to the original text's form and words.
